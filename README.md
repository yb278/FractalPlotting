# Fractal Plotting in Java

Welcome to my **Fractal Plotting in Java** project! This repository documents my journey in learning how to visualize mathematical fractals using Java. Fractals are fascinating mathematical structures that exhibit self-similarity and complexity, and this project aims to delve into their beauty and computational aspects.

## Goals

1. **Understand the Basics of Fractals**  
   Explore the mathematical concepts behind fractals, such as:
   - Mandelbrot sets
   - Julia sets
   - Recursive patterns

2. **Learn Java Graphics Programming**  
   Use Java's graphics libraries (like `javax.swing` or `java.awt`) to plot and render fractals.

3. **Optimize Performance**  
   Implement strategies to handle computational complexity and improve rendering performance.

4. **Interactive Visualization**  
   Enhance the project with features like zooming, color customization, and parameter tweaking for Julia sets.

## Features

- **Mandelbrot Set Renderer**  
  Generate and visualize the Mandelbrot set with customizable resolutions and color schemes.

- **Julia Set Renderer**  
  Explore different Julia sets by adjusting parameters interactively.

- **Zoom Functionality**  
  Zoom into specific regions to discover the infinite details of fractals.

- **Customizable Settings**  
  Change fractal parameters, such as iteration limits, escape thresholds, and color mappings.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code
- Basic understanding of Java programming

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fractal-plotting-java.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your favorite IDE.
3. Compile and run the main class to start visualizing fractals.

## How It Works

### Mandelbrot Set
The Mandelbrot set is generated by iterating the function:  
\[ z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c \]  
where:
- \( z \) is a complex number
- \( c \) is a constant complex number  

For each point \( c \) in the complex plane:
1. Start with \( z_0 = 0 \).
2. Iteratively apply the function.
3. If \( |z| \) exceeds a threshold, the point escapes the Mandelbrot set.

### Julia Set
Julia sets use the same iterative function but vary \( z_0 \) while keeping \( c \) constant.
